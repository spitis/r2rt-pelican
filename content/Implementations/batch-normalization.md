Summary: Batch normalization is deep learning technique introduced in 2015 that enables the use of higher learning rates, acts as a regularizer and can speed up training by 14 times. In this post, I show how to implement batch normalization in Tensorflow.

Batch normalization, as described in the March 2015 [paper](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03167v3.pdf) (the BN2015 paper) by Sergey Ioffe and Christian Szegedy, is a simple and effective way to improve the performance of a neural network. In the BN2015 paper, Ioffe and Szegedy show that batch normalization enables the use of higher learning rates, acts as a regularizer and can speed up training by 14 times. In this post, I show how to implement batch normalization in Tensorflow.

### The Problem

Batch normalization is intended to solve the following problem: Changes in model parameters during learning change the distributions of the outputs of each hidden layer. This means that later layers need to adapt to these (often noisy) changes during training.

### Batch Normalization in Brief

To solve this problem, the BN2015 paper proposes the _batch normalization_ of the input to the activation function of each neuron (e.g., the sigmoid or ReLU function) during training, so that the input across each training batch has a mean of 0 and a variance of 1. For example, applying batch normalization to the activation $\sigma(Wx + b)$ would result in $\sigma(BN(Wx + b))$ where $BN$ is the _batch normalizing transform_.

### The Batch Normalizing Transform

To normalize a value across a batch (i.e., to batch normalize the value), we subtract the batch mean, $\mu_B$, and divide the result by the batch standard deviation, $\sqrt{\sigma^2_B + \epsilon}$. Note that a small constant $\epsilon$ is added to the variance in order to avoid dividing by zero.

Thus, the initial batch normalizing transform of a given value, $x_i$, is: $$BN_{initial} (x_i) = \frac{x_i - \mu_B}{\sqrt{\sigma^2_B + \epsilon}}$$

Because the batch normalizing transform given above restricts the inputs to the activation function to a prescribed normal distribution, this can limit the representational power of the layer. Therefore, we allow the network to undo the batch normalizing transform by multiplying by a new scale parameter $\gamma$ and adding a new shift parameter $\beta$. $\gamma$ and $\beta$ are learnable parameters.

Adding in $\gamma$ and $\beta$ producing the following final batch normalizing transform: $$BN(x_i) = \gamma(\frac{x_i - \mu_B}{\sqrt{\sigma^2_B + \epsilon}}) + \beta$$

### Implementing Batch Normalization in Tensorflow

We will add batch normalization to a basic fully-connected neural network that has three hidden layers of 100 neurons each and show a similar result to Figure 1 (b) and (c) of the BN2015 paper.

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
import load_mnist #Google's MNIST loader, available: https://goo.gl/tjmpXP
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
mnist = load_mnist.read_data_sets('MNIST_data', one_hot=True)
sess = tf.InteractiveSession()
```


```python
#Using randomly predetermined weights so the networks are similarly initialized
w1_initial = np.random.normal(size=(784,100)).astype(np.float32)
w2_initial = np.random.normal(size=(100,100)).astype(np.float32)
w3_initial = np.random.normal(size=(100,100)).astype(np.float32)
w4_initial = np.random.normal(size=(100,10)).astype(np.float32)
```


```python
x = tf.placeholder("float", shape=[None, 784])
y_ = tf.placeholder("float", shape=[None, 10])
```


```python
epsilon = 1e-3
```


```python
# layer 1 without BN
w1 = tf.Variable(w1_initial)
b1 = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([100]))
z1 = tf.matmul(x,w1)+b1
l1 = tf.nn.sigmoid(z1)
```

Here is the same layer 1 with batch normalization:


```python
# layer 1 with BN
w1_BN = tf.Variable(w1_initial)

# note that pre-batch normalization bias is ommitted. The effect of this bias would be
# eliminated when subtracting the batch mean. Instead, the role of teh bias is performed
# by the new beta variable. See Section 3.2 of the BN2015 paper.
z1_BN = tf.matmul(x,w1_BN)

# calculate batch mean and variance
batch_mean1, batch_var1 = tf.nn.moments(z1_BN,[0])

# apply the initial batch normalizing transform
z1_hat = (z1_BN - batch_mean1) / tf.sqrt(batch_var1 + epsilon)

# create two new parameters, scale and beta (shift)
scale1 = tf.Variable(tf.ones([100]))
beta1 = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([100]))

# scale and shift to obtain the final output of the batch normalization
# this value is fed into the activation function (here a sigmoid)
BN1 = scale1 * z1_hat + beta1
l1_BN = tf.nn.sigmoid(BN1)
```


```python
# layer 2 without BN
w2 = tf.Variable(w2_initial)
b2 = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([100]))
z2 = tf.matmul(l1,w2)+b2
l2 = tf.nn.sigmoid(z2)
```

Note that tensorflow provides a `tf.nn.batch_normalization`, which I apply to layer 2 below. This code does the same thing as the code for layer 1 above. See the documentation [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/nn.html#batch_normalization) and the code [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/ops/nn.py#L639).


```python
# layer 2 with BN, using Tensorflows built-in BN function
w2_BN = tf.Variable(w2_initial)
z2_BN = tf.matmul(l1_BN,w2_BN)
batch_mean2, batch_var2 = tf.nn.moments(z2_BN,[0])
scale2 = tf.Variable(tf.ones([100]))
beta2 = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([100]))
BN2 = tf.nn.batch_normalization(z2_BN,batch_mean2,batch_var2,beta2,scale2,epsilon)
l2_BN = tf.nn.sigmoid(BN2)
```


```python
# layer 3 without BN
w3 = tf.Variable(w3_initial)
b3 = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([100]))
z3 = tf.matmul(l2,w3)+b3
l3 = tf.nn.sigmoid(z3)
```


```python
# layer 2 with BN
w3_BN = tf.Variable(w3_initial)
z3_BN = tf.matmul(l2_BN,w3_BN)
batch_mean3, batch_var3 = tf.nn.moments(z3_BN,[0])
z3_hat = (z3_BN - batch_mean3) / tf.sqrt(batch_var3 + epsilon)
scale3 = tf.Variable(tf.ones([100]))
beta3 = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([100]))
BN3 = scale3 * z3_hat + beta3
l3_BN = tf.nn.sigmoid(BN3)
```


```python
w4 = tf.Variable(w4_initial)
b4 = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([10]))
y  = tf.nn.softmax(tf.matmul(l3,w4)+b4)

w4_BN = tf.Variable(w4_initial)
b4_BN = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([10]))
y_BN  = tf.nn.softmax(tf.matmul(l3_BN,w4_BN)+b4_BN)
```


```python
sess.run(tf.initialize_all_variables())
```


```python
cross_entropy = -tf.reduce_sum(y_*tf.log(y))
cross_entropy_BN = -tf.reduce_sum(y_*tf.log(y_BN))
```


```python
train_step = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(0.01).minimize(cross_entropy)
train_step_BN = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(0.01).minimize(cross_entropy_BN)
```


```python
correct_prediction = tf.equal(tf.arg_max(y,1),tf.arg_max(y_,1))
accuracy = tf.reduce_mean(tf.cast(correct_prediction,tf.float32))
correct_prediction_BN = tf.equal(tf.arg_max(y_BN,1),tf.arg_max(y_,1))
accuracy_BN = tf.reduce_mean(tf.cast(correct_prediction_BN,tf.float32))
```


```python
zs, BNs, acc, acc_BN = [], [], [], []

for i in range(10000):
    batch = mnist.train.next_batch(60)
    train_step.run(feed_dict={x: batch[0], y_: batch[1]})
    train_step_BN.run(feed_dict={x: batch[0], y_: batch[1]})
    if i % 50 is 0:
        res = sess.run([accuracy,accuracy_BN,z2,BN2],feed_dict={x: mnist.test.images, y_: mnist.test.labels})
        acc.append(res[0])
        acc_BN.append(res[1])
        zs.append(np.mean(res[2],axis=0)) # record the mean value of z2 over the entire test set
        BNs.append(np.mean(res[3],axis=0)) # record the mean value of BN2 over the entire test set

zs, BNs, acc, acc_BN = np.array(zs), np.array(BNs), np.array(acc), np.array(acc_BN)
```

### Accuracy/Speed Improvement

As seen below, there is a noticeable improvement in the accuracy and speed of training. As shown in figure 2 of the BN2015 paper, this difference can be very significant for certain other network architectures.


```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

ax.plot(range(0,len(acc)*50,50),acc, label='Without BN')
ax.plot(range(0,len(acc)*50,50),acc_BN, label='With BN')
ax.set_xlabel('Training steps')
ax.set_ylabel('Accuracy')
ax.set_title('Batch Normalization Accuracy')
ax.legend(loc=4)
plt.show()
```

### Illustration of input to activation functions over time

Below is the distribution over time of the inputs to the sigmoid activation function of the first five neurons in the network's second layer. Batch normalization has a visible and significant effect of removing variance/noise in these inputs. As described by Ioffe and Szegedy, this allows the third layer to learn faster and is responsible for the increase in accuracy and learning speed. See Figure 1 and Section 4.1 of the BN2015 paper.


```python
fig, axes = plt.subplots(5, 2, figsize=(6,12))
fig.tight_layout()

for i, ax in enumerate(axes):
    ax[0].set_title("Without BN")
    ax[1].set_title("With BN")
    ax[0].plot(zs[:,i])
    ax[1].plot(BNs[:,i])
```

### Making predictions with the model

As a final note: when putting a batch normalized model into practice, make sure to replace the batch mean and batch variance in each batch normalization step with the mean and variance of the entire training set or population. In this particular model, I did not do this because the entire test set was predicted at once and the test set is large enough such that the mean and variance of the test set are good estimates of the mean and variance of the population. See Section 3.1 of the BN2015 paper.
